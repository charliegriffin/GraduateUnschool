This zip contains the following:

resizeable_image.py: You will be implementing best_seam() here.

imagematrix.py: Implements some utility functions that will make it
easy to manipulate images.  Note that the energy function is provided
here.

test_resizeable_image.py: Unit tests for your best_seam()
implementation.  On a Core i7, our reference implementation takes
about 1.75 seconds to run these tests.

gui.py: Graphical interface that lets you see the effect of seam
removal!  (Quite a bit of fun to play with, once you have it working.)

sunset_small.png and sunset_full.png: Sample images used in the unit
test suite (and also suitable for use with the GUI).
