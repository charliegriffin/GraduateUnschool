Part 1: Unloaded

The circuit is basically in the text book and can be described using
the following equation:
Vs=RB/(RA+RB)Vo

1. For a given set of values for R1 and R2 is increased, will the voltage
Vo increase or decrease?
decrease

2. If R1 = 100 Ohm and R2 = 10,000 Ohm, approximately what is the ratio
Vo/Vs?
1.01

3. If R1 = 10,000 Ohm and R2 = 100 Ohm, approximately what is the ratio
Vo/Vs?
101

4. If Vo = 1/5Vs what is the ratio R1/R2?
4/5

Part 2: Loaded

This is in the book too
Vs = VoR2/(R1+R2+R1R2/R3)

1. If R3 has a very high value, say 100,000 Ohm, how does the new value
of Vo compare to the value of Vd (defined above)?  Enter the approximate
value of Vo/Vd. (Enter a number with two digits to the right of the decimal point)
1.01

2. If R3 has a very low value, say 10 Ohm, how does the new value of Vo
compare to the original value Vd?  Enter the approximate numerical value
of Vo/Vd.  (Enter a number with two digits to the right of the decimal
point)
51.00

3. If R1 = R2 = R3, how does the new value of Vo compare to the original
value of Vd?  Enter the approximate numerical value of Vo/Vd.
1.50
