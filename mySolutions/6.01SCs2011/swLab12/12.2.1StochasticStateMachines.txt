Part 1: Distributions

Consider a universe with two random variables Disease and Test that we explored
in Software Lab 10.  The questions below refer to the Python representations that
we have worked with in that lab.

1. How do we represent P(Disease='disease')?	number
2. How do we represent P(Disease)?				DDist
3. How do we represent P(Disease='disease',Test='posTest')?	number
4. How do we represent P(Disease | Test)?		procedure
5. How do we represent P(Disease | Test = 'posTest')?	DDist

Part 2: SSM

Let m be an instance of the StochasticStateMachine class.  If s,x and y are
states, i is an input and o is an observation?

1. What is the type of: m.startDistribution?		DDist
2. What is the type of: m.startDistribution.prob(s)?	number
3. What is the type of: m.observationDistribution?	procedure
4. What is the type of: m.observationDistribution(s)?	DDist
5. What is the type of: m.observationDistribution(s).prob(o)?	number
6. What is the type of: m.observationDistribution.prob?	error
7. What is the type of: m.transitionDistribution(i)?	procedure
8. What is the type of: m.transitionDistribution(i)(y)?	DDist
9. What is the type of: m.transitionDistribution(i)(y).prob(x)?	number
10. Write a Python expression whose value represents P(Ot=o|St=s).
m.observationDistribution(s).prob(o)
11. Write a Python expression whose value represents P(St+1=x|St=y,It=i)
m.transitionDistribution(i)(y).prob(x)
