1. Consider the following circuit:

Assume that R1 = R2 = R3 = R4, what is the ratio of Vo/Vs? 1.0

2. Let's replace the part of the circuit including the voltage source
and R1 and R2 with its Thevenin equivalent (whose output terminals connect
to R3 and ground).  The resulting circuit is one of these two circuits.:

Which circuit is the correct one?	B
What is the Thevenin voltage source?	5 Volt
What is the value of the Tevenin Resistance RT?		500 Ohm
What is the value of Vo?	1000 Ohm
