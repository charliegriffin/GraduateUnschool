I am somewhat confused by the statement:
successors will be pushed onto the agenda in REVERSE alphabetical order
does that mean you follow the c path before the b path?
I will assume yes

1. What path will be found by breadth-first search:
A C F
2. What path will be found by depth-first search:
A C F
