Part 1: Op-Amp Constraint

k*n1 - k*n2 - 1*n3 = 0.

Part 2: Op-Amp Currents

1. i1 is equal to zero
So, for simplicity, we can
not include i1 in any equation

2. i2 is equal to zero
So, for simplicity, we can
not include i2 in any equation

3. i3 is unconstrained by the op-amp
So, for simplicity, we can
only include i3 in KCL equation at n3
