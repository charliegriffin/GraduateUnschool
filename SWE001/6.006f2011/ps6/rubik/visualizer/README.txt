This is the Pocket Cube Solver, which will serve as your visualizer for this
part of the problem set. This visualizer has been reused from the Spring, '11
edition of the course.

1) To run Pocket Cube Solver:

- On Windows: run the file "rubik_solver_GUI_Win.py" (not "rubik_solver_GUI.py")
  Make sure you have python installed, double-click on "rubik_solver_GUI_Win.py"
  to run.

- On Linux/Unix: run the file "rubik_solver_GUI.py"

  Open terminal, locate the folder containing "rubik_solver_GUI.py" and type
  "python rubik_solver_GUI.py" to run.

2) To use your own solving algorithm:

  Replace the "solver.py" file with your "solver.py". 
  Make sure it has function "shortest_path(start, end)" and obeys conventions
  set by "rubik.py"

3) Notes:

- Requirement: python2.5 and above
- The 2x2x2 rubik (Pocket Cube) should have the same color scheme with the one
  from www.rubiks.com: Front: Red, Left: Green, Right: Blue, Back: Orange, Up:
  White, Down: Yellow
- By convention, when entering your colors, make sure the yellow square
  containing the logo is on the far-right corner of bottom face.
