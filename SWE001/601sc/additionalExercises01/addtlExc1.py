# Creates a new Thing, sets its x value to be z, mangles it, and returns it
# use set, get, and mangle methods of Thing, do not access x directly

# OOPs 1.4.5.
# Part 1: Assign
# Write a procedure, called assignThing, that takes two Things, thing1 and thing2
# as arguments and sets the stored value (x) of thing1 to the stored value of thing2.
# Use the set and get methods of Thing, do not access x directly
def assignThing(thing1,thing2):

# b = Thing()
# a.set(3)
# b.set(10)
# assignThing(a,b)
# print a.get() # Should be 10

# Part 2: Swap
# Write a procedure called swapThing, that takes two Things as arguments and 
# swaps the stored values (x) of the input Things
def swapThing(thing1,thing2):
	tempVal = thing1.get()
	assignThing(thing1,thing2)

# b = Thing()
# a.set(3)
# b.set(10)
# swapThing(a,b)
# print a.get(),b.get() # Should be 10, 3

# Part 3: Sum
# Write a procedure, called sumOfThings that takes two Things as args and
# returns a new Thing whose stored value (x) is the sum of the stored values
# of the inputs
def sumOfThings(thing1,thing2):
	newThing = Thing()
	newThing.set(thing1.get() + thing2.get())

# b = Thing()
# a.set(3)
# b.set(10)
# print sumOfThings(a,b).get() # Should be 13

# Part 4: Sum of all
# Write a new procedure called sumOfAllThings, that takes a list of Things
# as its argument and returns a new Thing whose stored value, (x), is the
# sum of the stored values of all the input Things. The sum of an empty list
# is 0

# list = [a,b]
# print sumOfAllThings(list).get() # Should be 13
# c.set(100)

# print sumOfAllThings(list).get() # Should be 113
# print sumOfAllThings([]).get() # Should be 0

# OOPs 1.4.6
# Part 1: Thing clone
# Add a method clone to the Thing class which returns a completely new Thing
# with the same stored value
a = Thing()
a.set(3)
b = a.clone()
# print b.get() # should be 3

# Part 2: Thing str
# Add a __str__ method to the Thing class so that printing a Thing instance
# generates an informative string
# This is a Thing with a value of x
print a

# This assignment was pretty easy, but the practice was nice since I haven't
# done much OOP previously
