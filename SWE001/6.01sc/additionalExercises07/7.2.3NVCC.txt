Part 1: Equations

Indicate which of the following equations could be produced by steps 4
and 5 of the NVCC method.  Note that the equations must be consistent
with the directions of the current arrows that are shown in the diagram

2. -i1 - i2 = 0
6. i2 - i3 - i4 = 0
12. n1 - n3 = 36
10. n2 - n1 = 6i2
17. n2 - n3 = 3i3
20. n2 - n3 = 2i4
21. n3 = 0

Solve the equations for the unknowns:
1.	i1 = 7.5
2.	i2 = -7.5
3.	i3 = -3
4.	i4 = -4.5
5.	n1 = 36
6.	n2 = -9
7.	n3 = 0
