Part 1: Thevenin

1. Consider the following circuit:
VT = 20
RT = 2

Part 2: Thevenin

1.  This problem concerns the equivalent circuits for the following
one-port circuit, viewed from the port labelled V and I.

Isc = 7. Amps

Determine the Thevenin equivalent voltage if Rx = 3 Ohms.
Vth = 5.25 Volts

Determine Rx so that the Thevenin equivalent voltage is 4Volts.
Rx = 0.5 Volts
