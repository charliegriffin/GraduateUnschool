1. Find the Thevenin voltage and resistance looking into the port labeled
VA and IA in the circuit below:

Vth = 5.0 Volts
Rth = 1.0 Ohms

2. Find VBB and Rb so that the Thevenin voltage is 12 Volts and the Thevenin
resistance is 6 ohms when looking at the port labeled VB and IB in the circuit below.

Vbb = 2.0 Volts
Rb = 4.0 Ohms

3. Find Vcc and Rc so that the Thevenin voltage is 12 Volts and the
Thevenin resistance is 6 ohms when looking in port labeled Vc and Ic 
in the circuit below:

Vcc = 10
Rc = 1
